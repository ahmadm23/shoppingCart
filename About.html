        <p>Welcome to Ahmad's PC store!</p>
        <p>Micro Center was founded in Columbus, Ohio in 1979 by John Baker and Bill Bayne, two former Radio Shack
            employees, with a $35,000 investment. The first Micro Center store was established in a 900 sq ft (84 m2)
            storefront located in the Lane Avenue Shopping Center in Upper Arlington, Ohio. The store benefited from its proximity to Ohio State University and the scientific think-tank Battelle Memorial Institute, which provided a large customer base and a source of computer-literate salespeople. Their goal for the first year was $30 million in sales, and they achieved $29.9 million. In 2009, Micro Center developed an "18-minute pickup" service where customers who order merchandise on their website can pick it up from the store in 18 minutes. As of 2021, there are 25 Micro Center stores nationwide in 16 states, including California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.</p>
